## üì° API Reference


> ‚ùå This project currently does **not** include any API or back-end integration.


All dashboard data is loaded from static JavaScript files (see `assets/js/DashboardData.js`).

  completedTasks: 98,
  pendingTasks: 27
};
```


You can modify this file to simulate different data.

## ü§ù Contribution Guide - Dashboard Workflow


Welcome contributors for this project, this document details the main points of contributing to the Dashboard code.


### üõ†Ô∏è Setup


To start developing, you have to fork the most recent version of the repository, then clone it in your IDE of preference:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dashboard-workflow.git
```


DO NOT make a pull request directly into the main repository ‚Äî it may contain bugs or changes not approved by the maintainers.  
Instead, create a new branch in your forked repository:


```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```


Make your changes, test them locally, and then open a pull request. The project managers will review and, if approved, merge your changes.  
Also, make sure to sync your work with the upstream repository regularly.


### üßæ Commits


Each commit message should clearly describe the feature you are implementing.  
Avoid vague messages like `New feature` or `Fixed some bugs`.  
Instead, follow this pattern:


- `Feature: Added user auth menu`
- `Style: Formatted the code to project guidelines`


Small, well-documented commits help in tracking changes and easier reverts.


### üé® Style Guidelines


For UI consistency:
- Always use the `Inter sans-serif` font-family
- Add images or new files inside the `assets/` folder
- Refer to `assets/styles/style.css` for styling rules
- You can add new team members directly in `assets/js/DashboardData.js`, but you must keep the data structure as it is.


### üêû Bugs


If you find any bugs:
1. Open an **Issue** describing the bug in detail.
2. When fixing it, use the following commit message pattern:


```bash
Bug fix: Corrected sidebar collapse issue
```


Mention and close the related issue in your pull request.

The project initially did not follow good front-end development practices, featuring a simple and unstructured layout. However, with some adjustments and improvements over time, it began to incorporate more organized and efficient practices, resulting in a cleaner and more functional interface. To make it even more professional and scalable, it would be worth considering the use of a modern framework, such as React or Vue.js, which would provide a more robust and reusable structure. Additionally, integrating specialized libraries for data visualization, such as Chart.js, could significantly enhance the presentation of information, making the dashboard more dynamic and¬†informative.
